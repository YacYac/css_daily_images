# css_daily_images
This repository is for my work on the CSS Daily Images challange. Just as a disclaimer I don't exactly plan on doing these at a daily pace since I'm currently also working through CS50 and working through You Don't Know JS which takes up plenty of free time as is, so don't be suprised at sporadic commits here.

I'm also using this as a way to practice git branching, so each day will be in it's own git branch. I've commited a small boilerplate to master so far as a starting point, but all projects should be in their own branch.
